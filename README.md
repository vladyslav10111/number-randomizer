# Number Randomizer App

A simple PHP application that generates a random number between two values specified by the user.

## Features

- `FormRenderer` — renders a form for user input (two numbers)
- `Randomizer` — generates a random number between the specified range
- `index.php` — main entry point for handling form and output

## How It Works

1. The user inputs two numbers: the **first** and the **second**.
2. When the form is submitted, the app generates a random number within the range (inclusive).
3. The generated random number is displayed on the page.
